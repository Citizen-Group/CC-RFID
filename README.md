# Citizen Radio Frequency Identification (CRFID)

The **Citizen radio frequency identification system** is a hardware subsystem of the **Citizen identification system** (**CID**) known more commonly as the **Citizen Card**  The software and hardware components provided by the **CRFID** subsystem enable contactless communication of a encrypted **Citizen ID**. This powers the basis of the **Citizen Card** - a credit card sized **RFID** card, which in-turn powers the ecosystem of the Citizen identification system.

Utilizing the extremely low cost technology of **MIFARE** - a leading company in RFID card production and standards. The CRFID system is able to deploy in many forms, against many flavours and shapes of ID 'cards'. Scanners/readers can take the shape of everything from large freestanding or mounted panels for entry or outdoor use, embedded into visual displays for ticketing or venue gates, hand held or table/bar sized mobile devices for easy customer use, or even completely contained in a phone with NFC. The card is not limited to be a card, it can take the shape anything from a millimetre sized subdermal device to a small flat sticker to a full sized antenna array. 

CRFID development project represents the building, design and implementation of a self contained, deployable, hardware package to allow for the physical interaction of Citizens to the digital world. 

It is supported by parallel development of the Citizen Card software development and Member Database development.
